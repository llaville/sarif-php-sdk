## 2.0.0 - 2024-07-02

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This major release removed all converters that were introduced on versions 1.2.0 and 1.4.0
> You'll find them with a new architecture on future release 1.0.0 of new package `bartlett/sarif-php-converters`
> (repository: <https://github.com/llaville/sarif-php-converters>)

If you used this package since version 1.0.0, you won't be able to have BC breaks on standard API,
and fluent builders API.

Be aware that all `Definition` are now constructed without parameters. Look on setters, if you previously used any of them.
