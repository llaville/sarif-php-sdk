## 1.4.0 - 2024-06-02

I'm happy to announce a new converter :

### Added

- PHPMD : [PHP Mess Detector](https://github.com/phpmd/phpmd)

> [!NOTE]
> Even if PHPMD has a native [SARIF renderer](https://github.com/phpmd/phpmd/issues/858) since v2.10.0,
> this new converter provide more info, and is customizable as others.
