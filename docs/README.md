# About

This PHP SDK produces the SARIF output, which is a JSON file formatted
in accordance with the latest [specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html).
This implementation follows the general format rules but also specifies several custom properties
written in [property bags](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/os/sarif-v2.1.0-os.html#_Toc34317448).
